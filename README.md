# Odin-Recipes

A recipe website using only html for the time being.

Practiced Skills.

<h1> through <h6> were used for headers.
I also had to make a boilerplate for each page that I made. I typed each one out to try to commit it to memory.

Used <img> tag to place a photo for each recipe.

Used git to check status, add,   commit and  push . However I still do not get when I should complete these step and how to write a proper comment.

Used <ul> <li> and <ol> To create list to list ingredient and steps.

Used <a> to link to each recipe from the index page.

Used <title> to add text to the title bar of my web browser.
