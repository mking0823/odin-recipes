    <h2>Best Coffee Creamer</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time I could go to Giant Eagle or Target to get the greatest creamer ever known as Salted Caramel Creamer.</p>
    <p><b>THEN THEY TOOK IT AWAY.</b></p>
    <p>So now I had to look up how to make my own.</p>



    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups half and half </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons instant coffee </li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons dark cocoa powder </li>
        <li>1/4 cup caramel ice cream topping</li>
        <li> teaspoon coarse ground sea salt </li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Over low heat, whisk together the half and half, instant coffee, and cocoa powder until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Stir in the caramel topping, sea salt, and sweetened condensed milk. Remove from the heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>Store in a mason jar in the refrigerator. Go by the expiration date on the half and half container.</li>
        <li>Stir or shake well before using in your coffee.</li>
    </ol>
